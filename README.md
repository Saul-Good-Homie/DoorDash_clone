In this project, I am creating a clone of the DoorDash [homepage](https://www.doordash.com/). The purpose of this project is to create and then use your own grid based framework.

The custom grid-based framework is called "Saul-about-that-grid" and can be found in its online repo [here](https://github.com/Saul-Good-Homie/Saul_about_that_grid)

This is the final CSS Project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css/lessons/design-your-own-grid-based-framework)

Created by Saul Belisle, follow me on Twitter: [@saul_good_homie](https://twitter.com/saul_good_homie)
